## Resubmission

This is a resubmission based on the following queries from Uwe:

"Can you elaborate?
What are these points? What is OSGB36? ..."

- I have updated the README and DESCRIPTION
- These now explain the purpose and uses of the trig points
- I've specified that OSGB36 is the British National Grid coordinate reference system
- The README also includes relevant links to further information
